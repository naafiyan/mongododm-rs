MongDODM
=======


NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS!!! WE ARE STUDENTS AND RIGHT NOW THIS IS A VERBATIM FORK OF MONGODM, WHICH WE MAKE 1:1 USE OF!! 

WE WILL BE MAKING MODIFICATIONS HERE SOON 

A thin ODM layer for MongoDB built upon the [official Rust driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver).

Main features:

- A stronger API leveraging Rust type system
- Data structure models are defined using the well-known [`serde`](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde) serialization framework
- Index support on top of the `Database::run_command` (index management is currently not implemented in the underlying driver)
- Indexes synchronization
- Additional compile-time checks for queries using macros and type associated to mongo operators (eg: `And` instead of "$and")

## Examples

See [documentation](https://docs.rs/mongododm).

## Tests

Some tests can be run with `cargo test` however most of the useful tests requires a Mongo database running and exposed on `localhost:27017`.
These integration tests are run with `cargo test -- --ignored`.
